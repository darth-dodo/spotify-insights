- **No external servers** - Direct connection between your browser and Spotify's API
- **No tracking or analytics** - We don't collect usage data or behavioral patterns
- **Complete transparency** - Open source code available for full audit

### How It Works
```
Your Browser ‚Üê‚Üí Spotify API (OAuth 2.0)
     ‚Üì
Local Processing Only
     ‚Üì
Visual Analytics Display
```

const analyzeGenres = (tracks: SpotifyTrack[]) => {
  // This computation happens in YOUR browser only
  return tracks.reduce((genres, track) => {
    // No data sent to external servers
    track.artists.forEach(artist => {
      // Direct Spotify API data processing
    });
  }, {});
};
```
