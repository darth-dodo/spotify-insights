üéØ Implement Phase 1, 2, & 4: Enhanced Data Collection & Quality Indicators

## Phase 1: Enhanced Real-Time Data Collection System
- **Enhanced Spotify Playback SDK**: Real-time session tracking with actual listening data
- **Session Data Storage**: Persistent local storage for play counts, listening time, and completion rates
- **Playback Event Logging**: Track play/pause/skip/complete events with timestamps
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Confidence scoring based on real vs estimated data

## Phase 2: Intelligent Data Extrapolation
- **Pattern-Based Calculations**: Improved algorithms using user listening patterns
- **Enhanced Play Count Estimation**: Multi-factor calculation with recent play data
- **Smart Follower Estimation**: Genre-aware, popularity-based follower calculations
- **Discovery Year Intelligence**: Pattern-based discovery timeline estimation

## Phase 4: Data Quality UI Components
- **DataQualityBadge**: Visual indicators showing data source and confidence levels
- **ProgressiveDataDisplay**: Cards that show data improvement over time
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Automatic background data collection during app usage
- **Quality Tooltips**: Detailed explanations of data sources and confidence scores

## Enhanced Components Updated
- **Artist Detail Modal**: Real-time play data with quality indicators
- **Track Explorer**: Enhanced metrics using intelligent extrapolation
- **Data Quality Integration**: Badges showing API/Real-time/Calculated/Estimated sources

## Technical Improvements
- **Confidence Scoring**: High/Medium/Low confidence based on data sample size
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation from real data to smart estimates
- **Memory Management**: Efficient storage with automatic cleanup (1000 event limit)
- **Rate Limit Compliance**: 5-second intervals for API monitoring

## User Experience Benefits
- **Transparency**: Clear indication of data quality and sources
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Data accuracy improves with app usage
- **Educational**: Tooltips explain how metrics are calculated
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated improvements when real data replaces estimates
