### 🎯 **Data Accuracy & Methodology**

#### **Real Data Sources**
- ✅ **Track Count**: Direct from Spotify API
- ✅ **Artist Popularity**: Spotify popularity scores
- ✅ **Audio Features**: Spotify audio analysis (energy, danceability, valence, etc.)
- ✅ **Genre Information**: Artist genre classifications
- ✅ **Release Dates**: Album and track release information

#### **Calculated Metrics**
- ⚠️ **Listening Hours**: Potential time based on track durations
- ⚠️ **Play Counts**: Estimated using ranking algorithms
- ⚠️ **Song Share**: Calculated percentage of total listening time
- ⚠️ **Health Scores**: Weighted calculations based on multiple factors

#### **Simulated Data**
- ❌ **Discovery Dates**: Simulated for demonstration purposes
- ❌ **Freshness Scores**: Estimated based on popularity and position
- ❌ **Replay Values**: Calculated using popularity and audio features

### 🔧 **Technical Standards**
- **Minimum Value Protection**: All calculations include safeguards against negative values
- **Fallback Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for missing data
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data processing with React.useMemo and caching

## 🔧 For Developers

### Before Making Changes
1. Review the relevant documentation section
2. Understand the calculation logic and dependencies
3. Consider impact on other components
4. Test with edge cases (empty data, large datasets)
5. Update documentation if adding new metrics

### Common Tasks
- **Adding new metrics**: See METRIC_CALCULATIONS.md → Maintenance Notes
- **Debugging calculations**: Use METRICS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for formulas
- **Understanding data flow**: Review Data Processing Pipeline section
- **Modifying time ranges**: Check Time Range Handling section

### Code Standards
- Always use `Math.max()` for minimum value protection
- Include fallback values for missing data: `value || defaultValue`
- Use consistent rounding: `Math.round()` for scores, `Math.round(n*100)/100` for decimals
- Validate inputs before processing: `if (!data.length) return [];`

## 🎵 Understanding the Data

### Spotify API Limitations
- **Top Tracks/Artists**: Maximum 2000 items per request
- **Recently Played**: Maximum 50 tracks
- **Time Ranges**: Only 3 options (short_term, medium_term, long_term)
- **Audio Features**: Separate API calls required

### Calculated vs Real Data
| Type | Source | Accuracy |
|------|--------|----------|
| Track Count | Real | ✅ Accurate |
| Artist Popularity | Real | ✅ Accurate |
| Audio Features | Real | ✅ Accurate |
| Listening Hours | Calculated | ⚠️ Potential time |
| Play Counts | Estimated | ⚠️ Algorithm-based |
| Discovery Dates | Simulated | ❌ Demo purposes |

## 📈 Performance Notes

### Optimization Strategies
- Use `useMemo()` for expensive calculations
- Limit processing to visible/relevant data
- Cache results when possible
- Avoid recalculating on every render

### Memory Considerations
- Large datasets (2000+ items) can impact performance
- Consider pagination for UI display
- Clean up unused data references
- Monitor component re-renders

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Negative values**: Check minimum value constraints
2. **NaN results**: Verify division by zero protection
3. **Missing data**: Ensure fallback values are set
4. **Performance issues**: Review useMemo dependencies
5. **Inconsistent results**: Check time range mapping

### Debug Checklist
- [ ] Data is properly loaded before processing
- [ ] All required fields exist in data objects
- [ ] Calculations include minimum/maximum bounds
- [ ] Time range mapping is correct
- [ ] useMemo dependencies are accurate
